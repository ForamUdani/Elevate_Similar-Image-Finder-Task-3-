TASK                                                                                                        
Develop a Simple Similar Image Finder using AI and machine learning.
Utilize Python with libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for model
implementation. Use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract features from images. Compare these features using cosine
similarity to find and rank similar images. Implement a user-friendly
interface to upload and compare images. This project demonstrates your
understanding of deep learning, image processing, and similarity metrics,
providing a practical tool for identifying visually similar images.
